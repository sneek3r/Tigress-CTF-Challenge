# Reverse Engineering Challenge: **sneek3rs l33t VM**

Enjoy ChatGPT's README lol :)

Welcome to the **sneek3rs l33t VM** reverse engineering challenge! In this crackme, you'll be tasked with analyzing a binary file to recover the flag.

---

## Challenge Overview

### Files Provided

- **`challenge`** - The compiled binary you’ll be analyzing.
- **`source.c`** - The  source code used to generate the binary, though it does not contain the actual keys or encrypted flag. The obfuscation in the challenge.bin file is intended to add complexity and challenge your code analysis skills.

The objective of this challenge is to reverse engineer the binary and determine the correct sequence or inputs needed to reveal recover the flag.

### Objective

Using static and dynamic analysis tools, reverse engineer the binary to extract the encrypted flag. The binary may employ a range of obfuscation techniques, and the flag might be revealed only after satisfying specific conditions. Though there is a very easy way to solve this challenge, but the idea is to solve it by deobfuscating the code transformations, like reverse engineering the VM handlers etc

### Skills Tested

This challenge will test your understanding and skills in:

- Assembly language and binary analysis
- Static and dynamic analysis
- Reverse engineering techniques
- Obfuscation and anti-debugging methods
- Virtual machine analysis

## Getting Started

1. **Examine the Source Code**: Although `source.c` doesn’t contain the key or flag, it can give you insight into the structure of the program and where you can get started. The challenge is obfuscated, so be prepared to analyze complex code flows.

2. **Analyze the Binary**: Use tools like **Ghidra**, **IDA Pro**, or **Radare2** for static analysis. **GDB** or **x64dbg** can be used for dynamic analysis if needed.

3. **Identify Key Functions**: Look for functions that may contain encryption/decryption logic or flag verification mechanisms. Pay close attention to any routines that handle strings, check values, or perform calculations, as they could be related to revealing the flag.

4. **Retrieve the Flag**: The goal is to retrieve and decrypt the flag hidden within the binary. Once obtained, the flag should be in the standard format, e.g., `flag{your_flag_here}`.

## Rules and Guidelines

- **No Brute Force**: This challenge is designed for reverse engineering, so brute-forcing inputs may lead to incorrect or unexpected results. Analyze the binary and find the logical solution.
- **Sharing and Editing**: Participants are encouraged to share solutions, hints, writeups, and even this crackme itself! Feel free to modify, improve, or adapt it as you like.
